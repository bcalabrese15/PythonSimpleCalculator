Simple arithmetic calculator in python

So I'm pretty busy today and probably won't be able to code much, but I want to at least start something.

I'm going to start learning some python, because I believe I'll need it for tensorflow, which will be pretty helpful in future AI projects.

This is going to be a simple arithmetic calculator, so addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
